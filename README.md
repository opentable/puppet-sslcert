## Overview

Small defined type that will allow you to manage Windows certificates.

## Module Description

A module that will allow you to install and remove your certificates on Windows
machines. It will manage pfx, cer, der, p7b, sst certificates.

## Setup

### What sslcertificate affects

* Installs certificates into your Windows key stores

### Beginning with sslcertificate

  To install a certificate in the My directory of the LocalMachine root store:

```puppet
    sslcertificate { "Install-PFX-Certificate" :
      name       => 'mycert.pfx',
      password   => 'password123',
      location   => 'C:\',
      thumbprint => '07E5C1AF7F5223CB975CC29B5455642F5570798B'
    }
```

  To install a certificate in an alternative directory:

```puppet
    sslcertificate { "Install-Intermediate-Certificate" :
      name       => 'go_daddy_intermediate.p7b',
      location   => 'C:\',
      store_dir  => 'CA',
      root_store => 'LocalMachine',
      thumbprint => '07E5C1AF7F5223CB975CC29B5455642F5570798B'
    }
```

To install a certificate in the My directory of the LocalMachine root store using a different directory to store the scripts:

```puppet
    sslcertificate { "Install-PFX-Certificate" :
      name          => 'mycert.pfx',
      password      => 'password123',
      location      => 'C:',
      thumbprint    => '07E5C1AF7F5223CB975CC29B5455642F5570798B',
      scripts_dir   => 'C:\scripts_dir'
    }
```

To install a certificate in the My directory of the LocalMachine root store and set the key as not exportable:
```puppet
    sslcertificate { "Install-PFX-Certificate" :
      name           => 'mycert.pfx',
      password       => 'password123',
      location       => 'C:',
      thumbprint     => '07E5C1AF7F5223CB975CC29B5455642F5570798B',
      exportable  => false
  }
```

  directories, see [Windows Dev Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa388136(v=vs.85).aspx).
